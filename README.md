# Classification on Imbalanced Data

This project addresses the problem of class imbalance in classification tasks using Python-based machine learning techniques. Real-world examples include fraud detection, rare disease prediction, and more.

## 📌 Features

- Data visualization and analysis
- Handling imbalance using:
  - Oversampling (Random, SMOTE, ADASYN)
  - Undersampling
- Model training using:
  - Random Forest
  - XGBoost
- Evaluation with metrics suited for imbalance:
  - F1-score, ROC-AUC, Confusion Matrix

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- Python 3.8+
- pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn
- scikit-learn, imbalanced-learn
- xgboost

## 📁 Project Structure

- `notebooks/`: Jupyter Notebook implementation
- `src/`: Python scripts for data handling and modeling
- `outputs/`: Generated charts and results
- `report/`: Final PDF project report
